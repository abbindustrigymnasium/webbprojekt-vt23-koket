webbprojekt-vt23-koket created by GitHub Classroom

# Overview
We have created a project that displays which group is on kitchen duty at spetsen in abb gymnasiet. It shows the current group of the week but also a schedule of all other weeks of the year. The program is able to adapt itself to the current year to display the correct classes in the schedule. So the schedule should keep working year after year with the same concept that there are 6 "basgrupper" in every class and that the order of the schedule goes from "basgrupp "6-1" for every class.

# Startup
The project is built in simple html, css and javascript. Nothing specific is required to start the project. To produce the page, we used liveshare wich is a built in extension in visual studio code.
